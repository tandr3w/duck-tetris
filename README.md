Duck Tetris! (Real)

The ultimate Tetris practice tool. Play while a duck sabotages you, and practice recovering from tricky positions.

Story: So uhh, we originally had a really cool idea to make a Tetris practice tool that showed you optimal moves to achieve a goal like make a T-spin, Perfect Clear, get the max combo, etc. but that was wayyyy too hard for the time we had. Instead, we implemented a duck that sabotages you while you're trying to play. We learned a lot about Pygame, and how to use libraries effectively!


Run main.py to play.

do:

pip install tetris==0.6.1a0

pip install pygame
