# Duck Tetris! (Real)

Devpost Submission: https://devpost.com/software/duck-tetris

The ultimate Tetris practice tool. Play while a duck sabotages you, and practice recovering from tricky positions.

Story: We originally had a really cool idea to make a Tetris practice tool that showed you optimal moves to achieve a goal like make a T-spin, Perfect Clear, get the max combo, etc. but that was way too hard for the time we had, and we were only able to implement a Pygame client for Tetris that used a library for game logic. In the last hour, we implemented a duck that sabotages you while you're trying to play. We learned a lot about Pygame, and how to use libraries effectively!
